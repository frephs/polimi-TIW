# TIW project 2025
This repository presents my implementation of a web application assigned as coursework for the course "Tecnologie Informatiche per il Web" (TIW) at Politecnico di Milano held by professor Pietro Fraternali.

## Overview and stack
The project consists of a web application that manages an auction system. It allows users to upload, sell and bid on group of items. The application is built using the following technologies.
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Backend**: Java servlets, MySQL, Apache Tomcat.

The project is delivered in two versions: 
- a basic version with multiple pages and no JavaScript
- a more advanced version with a single page application (SPA) using JavaScript and AJAX.
